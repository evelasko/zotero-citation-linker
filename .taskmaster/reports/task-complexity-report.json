			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement URL-to-Reference API Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the URL-to-Reference API endpoint into detailed steps, including request handling, metadata extraction, and Zotero item creation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it involves integrating with Zotero's translation engine, handling various types of web resources, creating Zotero items, and managing potential errors. It requires careful error handling and integration with multiple Zotero subsystems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Plugin Preferences UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for creating the plugin preferences UI, including specific UI controls and their connection to the plugin's functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a preferences UI is moderately complex, involving XUL/HTML creation, connecting UI elements to Zotero's preference system, and implementing validation. The complexity is mitigated by Zotero's existing preferences framework."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Plugin Lifecycle Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the plugin lifecycle management implementation into detailed steps, including initialization, shutdown, and preference change handling.",
			"reasoning": "Managing the plugin lifecycle involves coordinating multiple components and services. It requires careful handling of Zotero events, preference changes, and potential error scenarios, making it a moderately complex task."
